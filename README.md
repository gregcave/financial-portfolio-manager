# Financial Portfolio Manager

*A personal finance application, built using Java, that tracks and displays the investments of a client. The program uses IEX's API service to track and display stock data live to the user.*
*The program also uses .csv files to store the user's portfolio information, allowing the user to view the total value of their personal investments at any given date within the last 3 years.*
*Furthermore, the program also allows for the possibility of the user having sold and bought some of the shares held during that historic period of time.*

## Getting Started

*To run the file, simply use the .jar file provided within this repository. You must keep this file in the same location (with the source files and .csv files) to allow the program to run correctly.*

### Prerequisites

*To work with the financial portfolio manager in a development environment, you'll need to install the following packages within IntelliJ:*

*fontbox: https://github.com/syntelos/fontbox*
*jackson-api: https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson*
*pdfbox: https://github.com/apache/pdfbox*
*xchart: https://github.com/knowm/XChart*
*xmpbox: https://github.com/apache/pdfbox/tree/trunk/xmpbox*

*It's not necessary to install these packages to run the program in a product environment, as they are already packaged into the .jar file so that it will successfully run when compiled.*

### Installing
