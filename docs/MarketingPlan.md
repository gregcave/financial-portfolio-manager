# Marketing Plan

*The marketing plan for our software is of a simple nature, as there is only one target market, furthermore, it is decided to release the software for free, under an open source license.*
*If however, the decision was made that the product should be sold, there is a number of different strategies that could be applied in regard to the sale of the software.*
*These strategies include releasing the software under license, using an authentication service with a CD key, or putting the software for download with adverts, generating revenue.*

# Customers

*The product is designed for financial investors, who are looking for a software package to manage their stocks portfolio. These investors will likely have small to medium sized portfolios.*
*The software is also likely to be used by mostly U.S. based investors, as it is built using the IEX API services (IEX is a stock exchange based in New York). However, it is not region locked.*
*It is not likely that the software will be used by large investment banks, hedge funds, and private equity firms, as they will almost certainly have their own software that uses special APIs.*

# Economics

## What is the total size of your market?
*The total size of the market for the product is estimated to be over 100,000 customers for the first quarter of 2019.*
*This estimation is based on data sourced from similar software projects (see 'Competition' tab below).*

## What percent share of the market will you have?
*It is estimated that we will have a market share of around 1.7%-2.8% for the quarter of this year (2019).*

## What is the current demand in target market?
*The target market is currently very saturated with similar software packages, including both web applications and open source software packages that are used by large investment banks.*
*It is because of this that the percentage market share is of such a low figure, as well as the customer base for the product itself.*

## What are the trends in target market?
*The economy is currently in a growth phase, and therefore it is estimated that there will be further growth in the target market for the foreseeable future.*
*It can therefore be determined that demand for these products will continue to rise, as consumers have a growing demand for managing their investments and personal finances.*

# Competition

*As mentioned above, there are many similar products already on the market, from a quick Internet search, the following products were found:* 
*OpenPPM:* https://sourceforge.net/projects/openppm/
*GnuCash:* http://www.gnucash.org/
*VisionProject:* https://visionproject.se/

*Our product is different to these, as for one, it is a native app that can run without a web browser, it is also completely open source and free, unlike some of the others.*
*Some of these products feature advanced GUIs, that have been developed over time. Unfortunately, our product has a very basic GUI, and this must be further worked on.*

# Product, Price, Promotion, Place

*Our team used the concept of the 4Ps to evaluate the performance of the product within the market, this allowed us to accurately predict the performance of the product in terms of sales etc.*

## Product
*Our product is a intangible service that fulfills a need of a consumer, namely, financial investors. Our product is unique as it provides an open source solution, whilst most other products are not open source.*

## Place
*The software will be both marketed and sold via the Internet. It is likely that most customers will come across the product through search engines such as google, or on online forums, the product will be available to download.*

## Promotion
*The product will be promoted through various types of advert, both on online forums, and investment websites, these are of low cost compared to traditional advertising on search engines or on the television.*

## Price
*It is agreed upon that the product will be released as open source, however if it was to be developed further, then it would be released under an authentication service, with a subscription of about £5 per month depending on sales.*

# Sales Forecast

*It is estimated that we will bring in around 100 to 1,000 sales in the first quarter of the year. We will then go on to achieve between 8,000 to 12,000 sales within the year.*
*Due to the fact that the software is licensed as open source, it will not generate revenue, however if it were to include adverts or a CD authentication service as mentioned above, it could make over £10,000.*
